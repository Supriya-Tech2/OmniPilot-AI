# ✨ Key Features

## 🤖 ADK Multi-Agent Workflow

* 🧠 **Planner Agent** → Parses user requests and orchestrates workflow execution
* ⚡ **Task Optimization Agent** → Prioritizes tasks based on urgency and importance
* 📚 **Exam Study Agent** → Generates active recall cards and study sessions
* 📅 **Life Scheduler Agent** → Creates optimized schedules and resolves conflicts
* 🔄 Sequential graph execution pipeline

```text
START → Planner → Optimizer → Study → Scheduler → END
```

## 🔌 MCP Server Architecture

The platform exposes local tools using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** patterns.

### Available MCP Tools:

* 🛠️ `optimize_priority`
* 📚 `generate_study_cards`
* 📅 `schedule_event`

Features:

* 📦 Structured JSON-RPC communication
* ⚡ Local tool invocation
* 🔒 Fully offline execution
* 🧩 Standardized tool schemas

---

## 📅 Intelligent Scheduling Engine

* 🕒 Automatic time-slot generation
* ⚠️ Conflict detection and resolution
* 📆 Weekly calendar planning
* 🧠 Study and productivity balancing
* 🎯 Goal-driven schedule optimization

---

## 📤 CLI Skills & Export System

The secure CLI tool (`omnipilot-cli`) allows:

* 📅 Export schedules as `.ics` calendar files
* 📝 Generate Markdown topic summaries
* ⚡ Trigger backend workflow skills safely

---

# 🔒 Security Architecture

Security is a first-class citizen in OmniPilot AI.

### 🛡️ Implemented Security Measures

* 🚫 **Path Traversal Protection**

  * Prevents unauthorized file access outside workspace
  * Blocks parent directory references (`../`)

* 🔐 **Subprocess Sanitization**

  * Sanitizes user inputs before shell execution

* 📏 **Input Boundary Validation**

  * Limits prompts to safe lengths
  * Removes unsafe HTML-like tags

* ⏱️ **Subprocess Isolation**

  * Executes CLI skills using secure subprocesses with strict timeout policies

* 🏠 **Workspace Restriction**

  * All generated files remain inside the local project workspace
